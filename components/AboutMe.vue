          General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Online (Flex)
          program</a
        >. I recently changed careers from Facilities Management to the Tech
        industry as a Web Developer at a telecommunications company. I take
        pleasure working in a career that I am extremely passionate about. As
        quoted by Marc Anthony;
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “If you do what you love, you'll never work a day in your life.”
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        I also offer an extensive array of soft skills, such as problem solving,
        leadership, mentoring, team building, project management and
        presentations.

        Technology has always been a keen interest for me, since getting my
        first computer in my early teens. Some of my hobbies included tinkered
        with various Linux distributions, creating websites and building hobby
        servers. Over the years, the interest in web development never faded.
      </p>

        After experiencing multiple extensive COVID lock downs, my thoughts on
        career and work / life balance has shifted extensively. I have come to
        the realisation that I want my profession to be something I genuinely
        love doing. For me, that is Software Development.
